The GCR Garbage Collector has been deployed as a CronJob.

The CronJob schedule is set to {{ .Values.schedule | quote }}.

You can manually trigger a job run:
kubectl create job --namespace {{ .Release.Namespace }} --from=cronjob/{{ include "gcrgc.fullname" . }} {{ include "gcrgc.fullname" . }}-manual
